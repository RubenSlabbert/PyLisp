# PyLisp

## TODO
* Make sure functions being impored from a library/file carry over environment dependencies
* Make some of the standard library be in pylisp
* Make optimisations
* Write more tests
* Implement almost the entire scheme standard
* Start work on a standard library

## Usage
To run pylisp you can execute the `bin/pylisp` shell file, assuming sh/bash/zsh/etc. is installed, otherwise running python3 main.py works too.
If pylisp is run without any arguments it starts an interpreter session, if run with an argument it attempts to open it as a file.
