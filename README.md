# PyLisp

## TODO
* Make auto currying work with builtins by implementing partials in evalprocedure
* Write more tests
* Implement almost the entire scheme standard
* Start work on a standard library
* Add autocurrying, i.e. calling a function with less than the expected number of args returns a partial function
