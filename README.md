# PyLisp

## TODO
* ~~Implement error handling in the virtual machine for various errors~~
* Make `(display)` not have a seperator between arguments
* Write more tests
* Implement almost the entire scheme standard
* Start work on a standard library
* Add autocurrying, i.e. calling a function with less than the expected number of args returns a partial function
